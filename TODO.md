# TODO

This document tracks design questions and areas that need further clarification.

- **Permissions granularity:** The exact permissions for each role (e.g., "organizer", "staff") need to be defined. For example, can a staff member view all events, or only those they are assigned to? Can they edit event details?
- **SuperAdmin UI:** How should the SuperAdmin functionality be presented? Should there be a separate admin dashboard?
- **Reporting details:** The specific requirements for the reports (e.g., filtering, sorting, data visualization) need to be defined.
- **Error handling:** A consistent strategy for displaying errors to the user needs to be designed.
- **UI/UX details:** Specific UI/UX details, such as pagination, sorting, and filtering for the lists of data, need to be fleshed out.
