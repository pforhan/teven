## Teven Backend Engineering Design

This document details the proposed backend architecture for Teven, focusing on the core technologies and a modular structure to ensure maintainability, scalability, and reusability.

**1. Backend Framework: Ktor**

We propose using [**Ktor**](https://ktor.io/) as the primary backend framework. Ktor is a Kotlin-native framework for building asynchronous servers and clients, offering several advantages:

* **Kotlin-Native:** Leverages Kotlin's modern features, type safety, and conciseness.

* **Asynchronous by Design:** Built on Kotlin Coroutines, enabling highly concurrent and non-blocking I/O operations without complex callback hell.

* **Lightweight and Flexible:** Provides a minimal core with extensible features, allowing us to pick and choose components as needed.

* **Ease of Testing:** Kotlin and Ktor's design promote testability.

**2. Database Access: Exposed**

For database interaction, we recommend [**Exposed**](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed), a Kotlin SQL framework.

* **Type-Safe SQL:** Exposed provides a type-safe DSL (Domain Specific Language) for SQL, reducing runtime errors and improving code readability compared to raw SQL strings.

* **Idiomatic Kotlin:** Integrates seamlessly with Kotlin, allowing for expressive and concise database operations.

* **ORM Capabilities:** Offers lightweight ORM features for mapping database rows to Kotlin objects.

* **Transaction Management:** Simplifies transaction handling with built-in DSLs.

We will likely use a **relational database** such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), given Exposed's strengths with SQL databases.

**3. Concurrency and Asynchronicity: Kotlin Coroutines**

[**Kotlin Coroutines**](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) will be fundamental to Teven's backend for handling concurrent operations. Ktor is built on Coroutines, making this a natural fit.

* **Non-Blocking I/O:** Crucial for efficient handling of many concurrent requests without blocking threads, improving server responsiveness and scalability.

* **Structured Concurrency:** Coroutines promote writing asynchronous code that looks sequential and is easier to reason about, reducing the complexity often associated with concurrency.

* **Lightweight:** Coroutines are much lighter than traditional threads, allowing for many more concurrent operations.

**4. Modular Project Structure**

A highly modular project structure will be adopted to promote separation of concerns, reusability, and easier maintenance. Each module will represent a distinct functional area or layer.

```
teven-backend/
├── app/                  # Main Ktor application entry point, server setup, routing
├── core/                 # Core utilities, common models, constants, error handling
├── data/                 # Database interaction layer (Exposed DAOs, database setup)
├── service/              # Business logic layer (orchestrates data and external calls)
├── api/                  # API Contracts (DTOs, request/response models shared with frontend)
├── auth/                 # Authentication and Authorization logic (JWT, RBAC implementation)
├── messaging/            # (Optional) Module for integrating with external messaging systems
└── build.gradle.kts      # Root build file
```

**Module Responsibilities:**

* **`app`**: The main application module. It will contain the Ktor server setup, dependency injection configuration, and define the top-level routing structure by integrating routes from other modules.

* **`core`**: Houses common utilities, shared data models (e.g., enums, base classes), constants, and custom exception definitions that are used across multiple modules.

* **`data`**: Responsible for all database interactions. This module will define the Exposed table schemas, Data Access Objects (DAOs) for CRUD operations, and manage database connections and transactions. It should not contain business logic.

* **`service`**: Contains the core business logic of Teven. Services will orchestrate operations by calling DAOs from the `data` module, applying business rules, and interacting with other services. This layer should be independent of the HTTP layer.

* **`api`**: Defines the data transfer objects (DTOs) and request/response models for the public API. This module can be shared with frontend teams if they are also using Kotlin/JVM, ensuring type safety across the stack.

* **`auth`**: Encapsulates all authentication (e.g., JWT token generation and validation) and authorization (RBAC logic) mechanisms.

* **`messaging` (Optional)**: If asynchronous communication with other services or external systems is required (e.g., for notifications, background tasks), this module would handle message production and consumption.

**5. Other Recommended Technologies**

* **Dependency Injection:** [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) or [Kodein](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Kodein-Framework/Kodein-DI) for managing dependencies between modules and components, improving testability and maintainability.

* **Serialization:** [Kotlinx.serialization](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/serialization.html) for efficient and type-safe JSON (or other format) serialization/deserialization.

* **Logging:** [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) with [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) for robust and configurable logging.

* **Testing:** [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) for unit and integration testing, along with Ktor's built-in test utilities.

**Conclusion**

This proposed backend architecture, built on Ktor, Exposed, and Kotlin Coroutines, provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for Teven. The modular structure ensures clear separation of concerns, facilitating parallel development and easier understanding of the codebase.
